Introduction to Statistics
--------------------------

I have now finished my book on an "Introduction to Statistics with Python",
and it will appear with Springer approximately in January 2016. The
corresponding git-repo - which is essentially the continuation of this repo - is 

https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python.git

which also contains the IPython Notebooks that go with this manuscript.

For the book the manuscript has been significantly extended, corrected, and
improved. For a short time, an outdated version of the manuscript will still be
available under http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/ 
I hope that when I have to take that manuscript offline, I will be able to
interest you in the full version of the book.

Python rocks - also for statistical tasks!
Author: Thomas Haslwanter

Why Use this Edit (Fork) of the Intro to Stats repository?
----------------------------------------------------------
My objective is to improve the original manuscript described above at all levels from
fixing typos, to inserting missing explanations, and checking that all notebooks will
run flawlessly with current versions of Python and supporting libraries.
The primary objective is to make this an easy-to-use reference for applying the Python
stats tools for common tasks, without need to refer to the textbook by Haslwanter.
I'm also very motivated to support the notion that most of us can do stats with Python 
instead of R, STATA etc.
